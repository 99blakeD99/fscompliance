## Task Management Guidelines

### Adding New Tasks
When adding a new task, include:
1. **Brief description** of what needs to be done
2. **Today's date** in YYYY-MM-DD format
3. **Phase/category** it belongs to
4. **Dependencies** if any exist
5. **Estimated effort** (Small/Medium/Large)

### Completing Tasks
When marking a task complete:
1. Change status to ‚úÖ **Completed**
2. Add completion date
3. Add any relevant notes or outcomes
4. Update any dependent tasks

### Task Priority
- **High**: Critical path items, blockers
- **Medium**: Important but not blocking
- **Low**: Nice-to-have, optimization

### Example Task Entry
```
- ‚è≥ Implement OAuth 2.1 authentication (2024-12-25)
  - Dependencies: User management system
  - Effort: Large
  - Notes: Research OAuth 2.1 vs 2.0 differences first
```
