---

## Vision & Mission

Compliance with legal, regulatory, and industry requirements is unavoidable in modern business, with Financial Services particularly affected. These requirements proliferate at an accelerating rate, and attempts to streamline them often create additional layers of complexity.

The consequences of non-compliance can be severe - both in public reputation and legal liability. Prior to AI, this burden was becoming unmanageable, creating mounting friction, costs, and reduced agility for Financial Institutions.

FSCompliance's vision is to leverage AI power through open-source innovation and MCPs (Model Context Protocol) accessible by any AI agent or LLM, making compliance manageable and efficient. Starting with the FCA Handbook, we'll progressively expand to other regulatory frameworks through a structured, phased approach, building collaborative compliance intelligence that benefits the entire financial services community.

## ü§ñ AI Agent Integration

### Q: How will AI agents decide to use the FSCompliance MCP Server?

**A:** AI agents discover and use FSCompliance through the standard MCP workflow:

1. **Resource Declaration**: An AI agent is configured to include the FSCompliance MCP server as one of its available resources
2. **Tool Discovery**: The LLM powering the AI agent reads all available MCP servers' JSON manifests to understand available tools and capabilities
3. **Intelligent Selection**: Based on the user's query content (e.g., "analyze this policy for FCA compliance"), the LLM determines that FSCompliance tools are most appropriate
4. **Tool Execution**: The AI agent calls the FSCompliance MCP server and uses the specific tools needed (e.g., `analyze_compliance`, `detect_gaps`, `extract_requirements`)

The beauty of MCP is that this happens automatically - AI agents can intelligently choose the right tools for regulatory compliance tasks without manual configuration.

### Q: What tools are available in the FSCompliance MCP Server?
