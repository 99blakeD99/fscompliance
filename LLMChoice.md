# LLM Selection Strategy for FSCompliance

## Executive Summary

At the start of the FSCompliance project, we set out to remain LLM-agnostic, allowing users complete freedom to choose their preferred language model. As the project progressed and we gained extensive experience with various models through comprehensive development work, we evolved our stance to **LLM-agnostic-with-strong-recommendation** - maintaining user choice while providing a proven default based on real-world validation.

After comprehensive analysis, we have selected **Claude 3.5 Sonnet as the default LLM** for FSCompliance MCP tools, with multi-model support preserving enterprise flexibility. **Claude 3.5 Sonnet has undergone extensive real-world validation through the comprehensive development of FSCompliance itself** - representing hundreds of hours of testing on complex regulatory analysis, multi-document synthesis, strategic planning, and technical architecture tasks that are directly analogous to production requirements.

This document outlines our decision framework, comparative analysis, and the strategic rationale behind prioritizing proven compliance accuracy while maintaining user choice in financial services applications.

---

## Strategic Decision: Claude 3.5 Sonnet as Default

### Rationale

**1. Proven Track Record Through Extensive Real-World Testing**
Claude 3.5 Sonnet has undergone the most comprehensive real-world evaluation possible for compliance applications through the development of FSCompliance itself. This extensive project work - encompassing complex regulatory analysis, multi-document synthesis, strategic planning, and technical architecture - represents a rigorous test of capabilities that are highly analogous to the functions FSCompliance will be asked to perform in production.

**Compliance executives' time is extremely valuable** (£150-500+ per hour), making it a false economy to experiment with alternative models that have not proven themselves in such a well-suited compliance context. The extensive validation through FSCompliance development provides unmatched confidence in production performance.

**2. Compliance Accuracy Is Critical**
In financial services, regulatory errors can result in:
- Regulatory fines (£10M+ for major institutions)
- Reputation damage and customer loss
- Legal liability and professional indemnity claims
- Operational disruption and remediation costs

The cost differential between LLMs is insignificant compared to compliance failure risks, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet's proven performance provides the highest confidence in avoiding such failures.

**3. Strategic Positioning**
Financial institutions expect premium solutions for regulatory compliance, with enterprise RegTech solutions typically costing $50,000-500,000+ annually. FSCompliance LLM costs represent a small fraction of total compliance spend while providing significant competitive differentiation through proven quality and expert-level reasoning capabilities that align with our "expert-backed" brand positioning.

## Multi-Model Architecture Implementation

### Tiered Service Approach

**Enterprise Tier (Default: Claude 3.5 Sonnet)**
