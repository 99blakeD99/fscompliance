# FSCompliance Planning Document

*Architectural vision and strategic direction by Blake Dempster, Founder & Principal Architect*

## Project Overview

**FSCompliance** is an open-source MCP (Model Context Protocol) service designed for financial services companies and institutions to manage compliance with identified "Conduct Requirements". The system will initially focus on the FCA Handbook but is architected to accommodate other regulatory frameworks.

This comprehensive planning document reflects deep regulatory domain expertise and enterprise-grade technical architecture designed to meet the complex needs of financial services compliance.

## Project Goals

### Primary Objectives
- Create an MCP-compliant service for financial regulatory compliance management
- Provide AI-powered compliance analysis and gap identification
- Support regulatory reporting and inspection preparation
- Maintain long-term memory for improved responses over time
- Ensure LLM-agnostic architecture with privacy controls

### Initial Scope
- **Regulatory Focus**: FCA Handbook (UK Financial Conduct Authority)
- **Target Users**: Compliance Officers, Risk Managers, Regulatory Inspectors, Professional Advisers
- **Core Technology Stack**: Python, Pydantic, LightRAG, GitHub
- **Default LLM**: LLaMA 3 (with architecture supporting Falcon, Mistral Medium, and user-defined models)

## Use Cases

### Primary Use Cases
1. **Compliance Gap Analysis**: AI agents submit policy text to identify the ten most salient requirements and flag compliance gaps
2. **Customer Risk Assessment**: AI agents query customer records against FCA requirements (e.g., "For customers aged 60+ holding Bitcoin, did the risk warnings meet FCA requirements?")
3. **Regulatory Reporting**: AI agents generate draft reports for regulatory inspections based on FSCompliance knowledge base

### Secondary Use Cases
- Real-time compliance monitoring and alerts
- Regulatory change impact analysis
- Training material generation for compliance teams
- Audit trail generation for regulatory compliance
