- ‚úÖ Add FAQ question comparing FSCompliance's custom memory approach vs MCP-Mem0/OpenMemory solutions

### Brand & Strategic Positioning
- ‚úÖ Develop comprehensive brand values and positioning document covering: Focus (Financial Services), B2B, Professional, Trustworthy, Expert-backed, Innovative, Global, Open, Accessible. Create positioning statement and competitive differentiation
- ‚úÖ Examine all .md files to make sure they square with the new ComplianceTools.md and add Blake Dempster, Founder & Principal Architect attribution where appropriate

### Strategic Planning & Analysis

- ‚úÖ Create internal/FCAsandbox.md capturing strategic opportunity and draft comprehensive answers to all FCA application questions (3.1-5.3) including solution overview, AI role, differentiation, impact, technical requirements, testing plan, and milestones
- ‚úÖ Evaluate database architecture options: Current PostgreSQL + Qdrant vs Supabase (PostgreSQL + PGVector + real-time). Consider compliance requirements, self-hosting needs, vector search performance, and Cole Medin's recommendations for financial services architecture

### User Interface & Presentations
- ‚úÖ Create FAQ.html version with nested structure similar to JBMD website format for professional presentation while keeping FAQ.md as source of truth
- ‚úÖ Consider adding new category in Tasks.md after Phase 2, maybe 'Carry out detailed review of project so far' and shuffle existing tasks as necessary

- ‚úÖ Create working HTML prototype (internal/UserInterface.html) to provide tangible first look at FSCompliance dashboard and key interface elements

### Quality Assurance & Consistency
- ‚úÖ Review all content .md files (FAQ.md, Tasks.md, ComplianceTools.md, and internal files) for consistency in terminology, branding, attribution, and technical details
- ‚úÖ Review Rules.md, Planning.md, and CLAUDE.md to reflect all documentation created and ensure they serve as accurate foundational guides (do this after content review)

### Development & Git Management
- ‚úÖ Commit .gitignore changes and ComplianceTools.md to GitHub with appropriate commit message
