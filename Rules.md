# FSCompliance Development Rules

This document establishes development guidelines and conventions for the FSCompliance project to ensure consistency, quality, and regulatory compliance across all contributions.

## ðŸ”„ Project Awareness & Context

- **Always read `PLANNING.md`** at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.
- **Check `TASK.md`** before starting a new task. If the task isn't listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- **Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as described in `PLANNING.md`.
- **Maintain MCP protocol compliance** - ensure all server implementations follow MCP specification requirements.

## ðŸ§± Code Structure & Modularity

- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.
- **Use clear, consistent imports** (prefer relative imports within packages).
- **Follow the layered architecture** defined in Planning.md (MCP Server, Knowledge Management, Compliance Intelligence, Memory/Learning, LLM Abstraction).

## ðŸ§ª Testing & Reliability

- **Always create Pytest unit tests for new features** (functions, classes, routes, etc).
- **After updating any logic**, check whether existing unit tests need to be updated. If so, do it.
- **Tests should live in a `/tests` folder** mirroring the main app structure.
  - Include at least:
    - 1 test for expected use
    - 1 edge case
    - 1 failure case
- **Include compliance-specific test cases** - test regulatory requirement parsing, compliance gap detection, and privacy controls.

## âœ… Task Completion

- **Mark completed tasks in `TASK.md`** immediately after finishing them.
- Add new sub-tasks or TODOs discovered during development to `TASK.md` under a "Discovered During Work" section.

## ðŸ“Ž Style & Conventions

- **Use Python** as the primary language.
- **Follow PEP8**, use type hints, and format with `black`.
- **Use `pydantic` for data validation**.
- Use `FastAPI` for APIs and `SQLAlchemy` or `SQLModel` for ORM if applicable.
- **Use Poetry for dependency management** as specified in Planning.md.
- Write **docstrings for every function** using the Google style:
  ```python
  def example():
      """
      Brief summary.

      Args:
          param1 (type): Description.

      Returns:
          type: Description.
      """
  ```

## ðŸ“š Documentation & Explainability

- **Update `README.md`** when new features are added, dependencies change, or setup steps are modified.
- **Comment non-obvious code** and ensure everything is understandable to a mid-level developer.
- When writing complex logic, **add an inline `# Reason:` comment** explaining the why, not just the what.
- **Document regulatory implications** - add comments explaining how code relates to specific FCA requirements when applicable.

## ðŸ”’ Security & Privacy

- **Never log sensitive financial data** or personally identifiable information.
- **Implement privacy controls** for all memory and learning features as specified in Planning.md.
- **Use secure authentication patterns** following OAuth 2.1 framework.
- **Validate all inputs** especially when processing regulatory documents or customer data.

## ðŸ¤– AI Behavior Rules

- **Never assume missing context. Ask questions if uncertain.**
- **Never hallucinate libraries or functions** â€“ only use known, verified Python packages.
- **Always confirm file paths and module names** exist before referencing them in code or tests.
- **Never delete or overwrite existing code** unless explicitly instructed to or if part of a task from `TASK.md`.
- **When working with compliance logic, always reference specific FCA Handbook sections** and include source citations in comments.
